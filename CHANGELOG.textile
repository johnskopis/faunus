h2. Faunus 0.x.y

h3. Version 0.4.0 (NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.thinkaurelius.faunus</groupId>
  <artifactId>faunus</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

* Renamed @FaunusRexsterExtension@ to @FaunusRexsterInputFormatExtension@
* Added @FaunusRexsterExecutorExtension@ which allows remote execution of a Faunus script and tracking of its progress
* Global GremlinFaunus variables are now available in @ScriptEngine@ use cases

==<hr/>==

h3. Version 0.3.2 (August 1, 2013)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.thinkaurelius.faunus</groupId>
  <artifactId>faunus</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.2</version>
</dependency>
```

* Fixed a bug in @SchemaInferencerMapReduce@ with @EmptyConfiguration@
* User can now provide their own @mapred.jar@ to deploy to the Hadoop cluster
* Graph database bulk loading is now fail safe as transaction size is the size of the input split
* Incremental bulk loading is now possible w/ @loading-from-scratch=false@ in @BlueprintsGraphOutputMapReduce@
* Number of reduce tasks to use during bulk and incremental loading is computed as a function of input split size
* Added more useful @PathFilter@ instances
* Generalized @HDFSTools@ for more generic use throughout Faunus
* Added @JobConfigurationFormat@ which supports dynamic job manipulation at execution time
* Bumped to support Titan 0.3.2
* Fixed a bug in @CountMapReduce@ where a value of 0 was not displayed
* Added @FileSystem.cp()@ to support copying paths within a filesystem

==<hr/>==

h3. Version 0.3.1 (May 21, 2013)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.thinkaurelius.faunus</groupId>
  <artifactId>faunus</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.1</version>
</dependency>
```

* Optimized the default in-memory filter for @VertexQueryFilter@
* Bumped to support Titan 0.3.1
* Updated all @ByteBuffers@ to @StaticByteBuffers@ (and associated updates)

==<hr/>==

h3. Version 0.3.0 (April 20, 2013)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.thinkaurelius.faunus</groupId>
  <artifactId>faunus</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

* Skipped Faunus 0.2.y line in order to synchronize with Titan 0.3.z
* Bumped to support Titan 0.3.0
* Bumped to support Hadoop 1.1.2
* Moved @IdentityMap@ to base directory as changed in Pipes 2.3.0
* Refactored the means by which MapReduce test cases are written
* @FaunusVertex@ property value serialization support using Kryo 2.2.1
* @FaunusVertex01@ provides history deserialization support for Faunus 0.1.z -> Faunus 0.3.z conversion
* Moved @util.MicroElement@ classes into respective @FaunusElement@ inner classes
* Added numerous test cases for file-based @RecordReader@ formats
* Added @ScriptInputFormat@ to support the arbitrary reading of an HDFS file lines into a @FaunusVertex@
* Added @ScriptOutputFormat@ to support the arbitrary writing of an HDFS file line from a @FaunusVertex@
* Introduced the @faunus.pipeline@ property namespace for properties that are global to the pipeline
* Added support for vertex-centric "filters" for isolating subsets of a graph @InputFormat@
* Fixed a severe bug in the propagation of @Configurations@ throughout a Faunus job sequence (@EmptyConfiguration@)
* Renamed @GraphSONUtility@ to @FaunusGraphSONUtility@ to avoid name conflicts with Blueprints
* Added @EdgeCopyMapReduce@ to support graph transpose for bidirectional edges
* @FaunusGraph@ now implements @Configurable@ and thus @getConf()@ instead of @getConfiguration()@
* Removed unnecessary combiner steps when the combiner only groups messages without compressing them

==<hr/>==

h3. Version 0.1.1 (March 22, 2013)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.thinkaurelius.faunus</groupId>
  <artifactId>faunus</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

* @OrderMapReduce@ semantics updated for number based properties (multiply by path count for efficiency)
* Improved the memory consumption and speed of @MemoryMapper@
* Bumped to support Hadoop 1.1.1
* Bumped to support Titan 0.2.1
* Bumped to support OpenRDF 2.6.10
* Bumped to support TinkerPop 2.3.0
* Added @script@-step which allows for arbitrary Gremlin/Groovy script executions on Faunus vertices
* Removed @step@-step as it was not clearly defined and difficult to use (see @script@-step)
* Fixed job jar finding issue by introducing @FAUNUS_HOME@ system property
* Complete refactoring of @FaunusCompiler@ and @FaunusPipeline@
* Added support for user defined @Input@- and @OutputFormats@
* Added @MapReduceFormat@ which allows an arbitrary number of MapReduce jobs after/before input/output
* Added configuration to allow Faunus to get the actual vertex count from Rexster when determining split size
* Added configuration to allow Faunus to authenticate to Rexster, if Rexster security is turned on
* Removed dependency on @Tokens.F@ with the inclusion of ordering in TinkerPop Pipes
